        <p>Whether you are a beginner or an expert in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) it is important to follow some best practices in order to keep your HTML documents consistent and organized. With so many elements, attributes, properties, values, and moreâ€”there is a lot to learn.

        <section id="1">
            <h2>1. Use proper document structure</h2>
            <p>HTML documents will still work without elements such as &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt; and &lt;body&gt;. However, the pages will not render correctly in every browser so it's important to be consistent using the proper document structure. <br> Example:</p>
            <img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lz10di53joM/Vae78dqUidI/AAAAAAAADXw/5CMPRLKAI7s/s320/html-structure.png" alt="Example of document structure">
        </section>
        <section id="2">
            <h2>2. Declare the correct doctype</h2>
            <p>When creating an HTML document, the first thing to declare is the doctype. This will tell the browser the standards you are using to render your markup correctly. The doctype goes before the &lt;html&gt; tag at the top of the page. If you are unsure about what declaration to use, W3.org provides information on <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Doctypes_and_markup_styles">choosing the right doctype.</a></p>
        </section>
        <section id="3">
            <h2>3. Always close tags</h2>
            <p>To avoid encountering validation errors always remember to have a closing tag for every tag you create.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="4">
            <h2>4. Don't use inline styles</h2>
            <p>It may seem like an easy route to place styling in line with the code instead of creating an external style sheet. However, inline styles are not a good coding practice because it makes it harder to update and maintain a website. Instead, keep your styles separate from your HTML mark-up.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="5">
            <h2>5. Use alt attribute with images</h2>
            <p>It is not required to have an alt attribute with images, which makes it easy to ignore. However, it is important to have a meaningful alt attribute for validation and accessibility reasons. The alt attribute provides context to screen readers so it should be descriptive as to what the image contains.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="6">
            <h2>6. Validate frequently</h2>
            <p>Instead of waiting until you are finished with your HTML document, validate your code multiple times as you work. This will help save some time in the end by identifying errors early on, especially if your document is lengthy. One popular HTML validator to use is W3C's <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">markup validation service.</a></p>
        </section>
        <section id="7">
            <h2>7. Place external style sheets within the &lt;head&gt; tag</h2>
            <p>
                Although external style sheets can be placed anywhere in the HTML document, it is best practice to place them within the <head> tag. This will allow your page to load faster.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="8">
            <h2>8. Use meaningful tags</h2>
            <p>Each section of your web page should be built using the most appropriate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">HTML5 tag</a> for the content. It's best to avoid excessive use of generic tags, such as &lt;div&gt;, when there could be a more descriptive tag for the job such as &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and so on.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="9">
            <h2>9. Use lowercase markup</h2>
            <p>Your HTML markup can be written in lowercase or uppercase and the web page will render correctly. However, it is best practice to keep tag names in lowercase because it is easier to read and maintain.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="10">
            <h2>10. Reduce the number of elements on a page</h2>
            <p>
                HTML documents can become complicated, especially for webpages with a lot of content. To reduce the size of your pages, check for opportunities to further optimize your code once you are finished with your markup.
